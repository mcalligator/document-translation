[AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/) is a secure, highly scalable, fully managed source control service that hosts private Git repositories.

Using the terminal (E.g. [CloudShell]({{< ref "docs/shared/prerequisites/cloudshell" >}})) perform the following commands. The specific repository name of "document-translation" is not a requirement. You can substitute this name with another name. The name must be unique and is referenced in later steps.

```sh
# Define a repository name
export sourceGitRepo="document-translation"
# Create a CodeCommit repository
aws codecommit create-repository --repository-name ${sourceGitRepo}
```

Take note of the output provided by the above commands.
