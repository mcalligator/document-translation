{{< callout type="error" >}}
This step is **required**. Many options below are required whilst others are optional.
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout type="info" >}}
It is important that the below options are defined in the same shell session as the deploy step.
{{< /callout >}}

This solution is configurable to meet your specific needs. In this step you will specify which features you want enabled or disabled. To configure an option use the terminal (E.g. [CloudShell]({{< ref "docs/shared/prerequisites/cloudshell" >}})) to perform the relevant commands.

## Source Code Service

The git source type information is a **required** configuration. There are 2 values to set in this section and they differ based on whether you're using CodeCommit or GitHub to host your code. The recommended option is to use CodeCommit, which is the default.

**If using CodeCommit**

```sh
export sourceGitRepo="document-translation"
```

**If using GitHub**

```sh
export sourceGitService="github"
export sourceGitRepo="<your-github-username>/<your-repo-name>"
export sourceConnectionArn="<arn of connection manually created in CodePipeline>"
```

## Source Code Branch

The git source repository information is a **required** configuration.

```sh
export sourceGitBranch="main"
```

## User Authentication

This solution supports two sources of user authentication. These can be enabled individually or together.

1. AWS Cognito Local Users

- Recommended for testing
- Users are managed within the AWS Account
- Users are not linked to existing user directories
- Configurable MFA settings

1. AWS Cognito SAML Users

- Recommended for production usage
- Users are managed by a SAML provider
- Users are linked to existing user directories
- Configuration of SAML provider is out of scope for this installation guide

### Enable Cognito Local Users

```sh
export cognitoLocalUsers="true"
export cognitoLocalUsersMfa="required"
export cognitoLocalUsersMfaOtp="true"
export cognitoLocalUsersMfaSms="true"
```

### Enable Cognito SAML Provider Users

To integrate this solution with your existing user accounts it is integrated via SAML 2.0. This is supported by most user management systems, such as Azure Active Directory. A metadata URL is provided by the SAML provider and used by this solution. This URL looks like this `https://login.microsoftonline.com/yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml?appid=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`. Configuration of Azure AD is out of scope for this installation guide.

This installation guide assumes that the user directory used for the SAML provider is Azure Active Directory. Configuration of Azure AD is out of scope for this installation guide. An Enterprise Application will need to be created. Dummy information can be used for the "Identifier (Entity ID)" and "Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)" to be updated later in this guide. The "App Federation Metadata Url" is a dependency for this guide.

```sh
export cognitoSamlUsers="true"
export cognitoSamlMetadataUrl="https://domain.tld/path/to/metadata.xml"
```

## Enable Web UI

This solution ships with a Web UI which is can be simply customised to fit your branding. Where integration with existing systems or much larger customisation is desired, the solution can be deployed without the web UI and provide just an API to integrate with.

```sh
export webUi="true"
```
